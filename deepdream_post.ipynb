    "Modern convolutional neural networks, like the one we built in the previous post are trained to detect faces or other objects in images. With multiple layers in a neural network, it can be difficult to understand how exactly the neurons in the network respond and activate to patterns in an image. \n",
    "\n",
    "One way to understand the emergent structure of a trained deep neural net is to run it in reverse. Instead of adjusting the weights of the neurons in each training iteration, the image itself can be adjusted so that an output neuron gives a higher confidence score. Put simply, a neural net trained to recognise dogs will alter the image to appear more 'dog-like' when run in reverse. The technique was popularised by the DeepDream program, created by Google engineer Alexander Mordvintsev. \n",
